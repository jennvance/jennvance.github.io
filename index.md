## What I Do As A Technical Writer

## Bio

I was a developer on and off for seven years before learning that writing technical documentation can be a full time job unto itself. (Why "on and off"? Because I kept quitting my jobs to travel and write bad novels. As a career move I do not recommend this.)

I like to code, but I like writing even more. My favorite thing about coding is there are infinite new concepts to learn. Technical writing shares the same benefit, perhaps to an even greater extent because a technical writer can write across multiple disciplines.

I made my first open source contributions to documentation a few weeks back as part of HacktoberFest. I enjoyed the collaboration and the opportunity to explore new applications and technologies. At the moment I'm looking for more projects to contribute to.

Though I’m only now entering the field of Technical Writing in an official capacity, I did contribute some documentation to various projects as part of my role as developer. Furthermore, I trained new developers while working at several previous jobs, which required an ability to articulate technical concepts verbally.

My obsession with writing shows up in my personal projects. To teach myself new technologies, I've built a platform to connect indie authors with beta readers and a word count tracking app where writers can track their word counts, earn badges, and follow other writers.

Recently, a feature-length screenplay I wrote was a finalist in the Virginia Screenwriting Competition. I mention this because I believe screenwriting and technical writing have much in common: both require the writer to write concisely, convey a lot of meaning using limited words, and adhere to a logical structure.

## Where I'm Headed
I'd like to write for a technical audience in the fields of code/API documentation, devOps, and InfoSec. I seek challenging, stimulating work and the opportunity to grow both technically and as a technical communicator.

## Resume
Coming soon.

## Portfolio
I wrote some documentation to help technical writers become comfortable with technical concepts. You can view the guides [here](https://github.com/jennvance/bash-commands).
